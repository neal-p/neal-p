Hi, I’m Patrick Neal
- I’m a chemistry student at Norhteastner University working in the Lopez Lab

- I found computational chemistry in my first year of undergrad, and have really loved it

- I only got started really developing with python in 2019 and you can probably see the 
  embarassingly bad early days...
  
- I'm really interested in making cheminformatics tools for chemists
  whether that be for drug discovery or materials design
